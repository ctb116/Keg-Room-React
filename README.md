# _Keg Room in React_

#### _Independent Project for Epicodus, 11.16.2018_

#### By _**Catherine Bradley**_

## Description
_This app is a remake of a previous project done in Angular._
README prompt for Epiocus: Thoughts on the differences in development process between Angular and React. Angular and React both use components. My early impressions are that Angular's development process is more organized in use of its components. It seems that React does better when components are smaller and more specialized. This is fine for me until it comes to styling.

## Unforseen Issues/Questions
I currently have trouble understanding how to style in React given that there are so many smaller components. I seems I am trying to style accross components most of the time.
